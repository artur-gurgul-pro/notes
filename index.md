## Welcome to my website!

This site was generated using **`sajt`**, a project I’m currently developing and looking for contributors to help improve.

- **Sajt**: [https://github.com/artur-gurgul-pro/sajt](https://github.com/artur-gurgul-pro/sajt)  
- **This website's source**: [https://github.com/artur-gurgul-pro/notes](https://github.com/artur-gurgul-pro/notes)

### Currently Supported
- Pug  
- Markdown  
- HTML

### Experimental Support
- YAML

### Planned Features
- Audio and video file support

The idea behind **sajt** is simple: turn your notes and content into a website with zero hassle. Just drop your files into a folder, run a command, and you’ve got a website ready to be uploaded to your hosting provider.
